/**
 * Utility class that holds project-wide constants and configuration values. This class provides a
 * centralized location for defining constants that are used across multiple classes and components
 * within the project.
 *
 * <p>This utility class is designed to contain static final fields that represent immutable
 * configuration values, string literals, numeric constants, and other project-specific constants
 * that need to be shared across the application.
 *
 * <p>As a utility class, this class should not be instantiated and all members should be static and
 * public for easy access throughout the project.
 *
 * @see {@link HelperMethods} for complementary reusable helper functions operating on constant
 *     values.
 * @see {@link ProjectProperties} for dynamically loaded configuration properties that augment these
 *     static constants.
