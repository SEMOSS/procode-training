 * Utility class that provides common helper methods and utility functions used throughout the

 * domain class but are needed across multiple components of the application. Examples include
 * string manipulation, data conversion, validation, and other general-purpose operations.
 *
 * <p>As a utility class, this class should not be instantiated and all methods should be static and
 * public for easy access throughout the project.
