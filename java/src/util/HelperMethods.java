/**
 * Utility class that provides common helper methods and utility functions used throughout the
 * project for various operations and data processing tasks.
 *
 * <p>This class serves as a repository for reusable utility methods that don't belong to a specific
 * domain class but are needed across multiple components of the application. Examples include
 * string manipulation, data conversion, validation, and other general-purpose operations.
 *
 * <p>As a utility class, this class should not be instantiated and all methods should be static and
 * public for easy access throughout the project.
 *
 * @see {@link Constants} for static configuration values that may be manipulated or referenced by
 *     future helper methods.
 * @see {@link ProjectProperties} for dynamic property values that helper methods may consume.
